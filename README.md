## Description

For my capstone project, I created a shiny app about how the press in the USA has changed with the rise of the internet. In it, I explore the decline of newspapers (especially local papers) over the past two decades.

The data used belongs to the University of North Carolina and was used with their permission.

 _Check out the application in action [here](https://opioidsalex.shinyapps.io/news_disappeared/)!_

## Application Specs

 _Use the first tab to find your state (or any other state of interest) and explore newspaper trends by county and state_

_Use the second tab to visualize these trends using a cartogram of the US by state, in which various data points are substituted for land area._


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the repository_
* _Open global.R, server.R, ui.R_
* _Adjust as necessary_
